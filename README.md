# java-2048

A rendition of one of my childhood mobile games made in Java. I learned from my previous GUI of Tic Tac Toe, and now the gamePanel is tied to the window size. This means that the window can be made smaller or larger and the game board will stay at the perfect size. I've also been enjoying using gray-scale lately for the color pallette hence the monochrome look here. Enjoy.

A restart function is implemented for endless replay.
